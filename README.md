# Hex of Galaxy

Hex of Galaxy is a color-matching game where players match the colors of the planets that appear on the screen. This game is designed to bring back the nostalgia of our childhood fascination with the colorful wonders of the universe. The gameplay is simple: players match colors based on hue and brightness. To be more challenging, players are given a limited amount of time and lives, which will affect their final score at the end of the game.
