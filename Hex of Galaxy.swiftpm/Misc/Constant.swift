                Welcome to the mission, Captain!

                The objective of this mission is to match the color of the big circle with the color of the planet given to you.
                
                You can interact with the big circle by swiping up and down to adjust the hue and swiping left and right to adjust the brightness. When you think you have the correct color, tap the big circle twice to submit your answer.

                You will start the mission with 5 lives. Lives will be deducted each time you run out of time or answer incorrectly. The faster you answer correctly, the higher your score will be.
                
                If you require any assistance during the game, simply tap the question mark (?) icon located at the bottom left corner of your screen.

                At the end of the mission, you will receive a spirit planet based on your highest score. Good luck, Captain!
